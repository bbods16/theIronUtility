# The Iron Utility (v1: Squat Form Analysis)

## Project Objective

To provide real-time, corrective feedback on a user's squat form by analyzing their webcam video feed directly in their browser. This project focuses on a two-step pipeline: real-time pose estimation followed by sequence classification of body keypoints to identify form errors.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as a monorepo to manage all components of the ML model development lifecycle, from data processing to training, evaluation, and deployment.

```
/src/                 # data modules, models, losses, metrics, trainers, inferencing
/src/data/            # datasets, dataloaders, augmentations, tokenizers
/src/models/          # architectures, heads, adapters (LoRA/PEFT)
/src/train/           # train loops, schedulers, callbacks, checkpoints
/src/eval/            # metrics, eval suites, robustness, calibration
/scripts/             # CLI entrypoints: prepare_data, train, evaluate, export, serve
/notebooks/           # EDA, sanity checks (kept lightweight)
/tests/               # unit/integration/smoke (CPU & small GPU subsets)
/configs/             # Hydra/YAML configs (data/model/train/eval/export)
/experiments/         # tracked runs, artifacts index (symlinked to MLflow/W&B)
/models/              # exported artifacts (TorchScript/ONNX/HF), model cards
/data/                # DVC/LFS pointers, no raw big files

## Setup and Installation

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/the-iron-utility.git
    cd the-iron-utility
    ```

2.  **Install `uv`:**
    If you don't have `uv` installed, you can get it via `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
    This will install both runtime and development dependencies.

## Development Workflow

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses `ruff`, `black`, and `isort` for code quality and formatting. These are configured via `pyproject.toml`.

To run checks:
```bash
ruff check .
black --check .
isort --check-only .
```

To fix issues:
```bash
ruff check . --fix
black .
isort .
```

### Type Checking

`mypy` is used for static type checking.
```bash
mypy src/
```

### Testing

`pytest` is used for unit and integration tests.
```bash
pytest
```
